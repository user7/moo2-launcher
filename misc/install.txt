                              ===================
                               MOO2 PATCH 1.50.x
                              ===================

This is an unofficial fan patch for Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares.
It is not supported by a company or anyone at all. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Installation of the patch does not break your current MOO2 installation. No
original files are overwritten. To run your old version (e.g. GOG or Steam),
use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2 Launcher shortcut created
during installation.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------
- A working copy of MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher.
- The MOO2 game directory should contain ALL game files (full installation).
- English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

INSTALLATION WITH MOO2 LAUNCHER:
--------------------------------
1. Unzip the installation package anywhere OUTSIDE of your MOO2 game directory.

2. a. Windows: run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux: run ./install-linux in terminal inside unzipped directory * **.
   c. Mac OS X: right click install-macosx and choose open.

3. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt, which should auto-
   detect GOG and Steam distros. If there was no auto-detection, then specify
   path to MOO2 game directory and path to emulator:
   a. "DOSBox.exe" on Windows
   b. "dosbox" on Linux
   c. "Boxer Standalone" or "dosbox" on Mac OS X

4. Press Install.

5. After reporting success MOO2 Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where
   you can run the game. Choose a mod & map, then press Launch! to play.

6. On subsequent runs the MOO2 Launcher won't prompt installation, and allows
   the game to start right away. To start MOO2 1.50, use the desktop shortcut
   created during installation.

*  To change directory to unzipped package do:
   $ cd "~/Downloads/MOO2-1.50.x"

** At least Ubuntu & Mint require installation of Tcl/Tk before step 2, run:
   $ sudo apt-get install tcl tk

MANUAL INSTALLATION:
--------------------
The MOO2 Launcher runs on recent Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems. Still it
may happen that on your system it doesn't work. In that case you can install
the patch manually.

1. Find in the 1.50 package the directory named "patch". Copy all its files
into your MOO2 directory. The MOO2 directory is the one that contains
ORION2.EXE, it's location may vary depending on OS and distribution. If you
already have a version of 1.50 installed then choose to overwrite files.

2. Update your DOSBox config files to run ORION150.EXE instead of ORION2.EXE.

3. Run the game and confirm that the version number in the bottom right corner
of MOO2's Title screen is 1.50.x.

Edit file 150/ENABLE.CFG manually to change enabled mods without MOO2 Launcher.

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
?  Do I need to make a backup of my build lists before updating to new version?
>  Your build lists are automatically backed-up during installation with MOO2
   Launcher. They can be retrieved in directory '150-backups'.

?  MOO2 Launcher runs but fails to install with 'permission denied' error.
?  MOO2 Launcher runs but cannot locate game files on your system.
>  This happens if the destination is write-protected, for example for CD-rom
   version installed to Program Files. Make MOO2 directory accessible or move
   the game to an accessible location, like C:\GAMES\MOO2.
   In some cases you can workaround the issue by running MOO2 Launcher as an
   administrator, but you'll have to do it every time you run it, so that's not
   recommended. This problem doesn't affect Steam and GOG packages even though
   Steam installs to Program Files.

?  MOO2 Launcher runs but fails to install with 'Error creating backup'.
>  This can happen when an instance of Windows Explorer is open that has focus
   on a directory or file inside the MOO2 game directory. Close the Explorer.
>  This can also happen if you have a previous version MOO2 Launcher still
   running. Make sure you have that MOO2 Launcher closed before updating.

?  DOSBox crashes immediately after starting.
>  Try setting output to 'surface'.

?  Game doesn't start, cannot find info.lbx, credits.lbx and diplomse.lbx.
>  This happens when the game is installed from an original CD-rom. To fix it,
   copy all files from CD-rom to e.g. C:\GAMES\MOO2, remove read-only attribute
   from all files, then install patch 1.31, then install patch 1.50. The order
   of actions is important, install 1.31 after you copied the cd-rom files.

?  Music plays, but no sound effects.
>  You need to make the file sound.lbx writable. On Windows right-click it,
   choose properties, remove read-only checkbox.

?  Game interface lags, sound is crackling.
>  May happen on Ubuntu with opengl output. Try 'overlay'.

?  How to edit DOSBox options not accessible via MOO2 Launcher?
>  Edit file 150/dosbox.conf in the game directory. Note that the settings in
   this file override MOO2 Launcher settings, so if you e.g. force resolution
   there, changing it in MOO2 Launcher will no longer work.

?  I want the game to run in 16:9 mode.
>  The game was designed for 4:3 monitors. In DOSBox windowed mode you can only
   have that. In full screen your monitor handles whether to stretch to maximum
   resolution, explore its OSD to figure out how to do it. Note that you will
   never have a true 16:9 picture, the game uses a fixed resolution and in 16:9
   everything will look stretched.

?  I'm trying to create custom BUILD lists but editing the 150\build\build*.cfg
   files doesn't do anything. The original BUILD lists are still loaded.
>  You have edited the wrong files. Open the BUILD lists from MOO2 Launcher's
   menu 'Game>Build lists' to make sure the correct files are edited.
