                              ===================
============================== MOO2 PATCH 1.50.x ===============================
                              ===================

This is an unofficial fan patch for Master of Orion II: Battle at Antares.
It is not supported by a company or anyone at all. USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Installation of the patch does not break your current MOO2 installation. No
original files are overwritten. To run your old version (e.g. GOG or Steam),
use your old shortcut and to run 1.50 use the MOO2 Launcher shortcut created
during installation.

                                 --------------
--------------------------------- REQUIREMENTS ---------------------------------
                                 --------------
1. A working copy of MOO2 DOS version 1.31 or higher.
2. The MOO2 game directory should contain ALL game files (full installation).
3. English, French, German, Italian and Spanish languages are supported.

                       ---------------------------------
----------------------- INSTALLATION WITH MOO2 LAUNCHER ------------------------
                       ---------------------------------
1. Unzip the installation package anywhere OUTSIDE of your MOO2 game directory.

2. a. Windows:  run install-win32.exe.
   b. Linux:    run ./install-linux in terminal inside unzipped directory. * **
   c. Mac OS X: right click install-macosx and choose open. ^

3. You will be presented with a patch installation prompt, which should auto-
   detect GOG and Steam distros. If there was no auto-detection, then specify
   path to MOO2 game directory and path to emulator:
   a. Windows:  "DOSBox.exe"
   b. Linux:    "dosbox"
   c. Mac OS X: "Boxer Standalone" or "dosbox"

4. Press Install.

5. After reporting success MOO2 Launcher will switch to normal mode, from where
   you can run the game. Choose a mod & map, then press Launch! to play.

6. On subsequent runs the MOO2 Launcher won't prompt installation, and allows
   the game to start right away. To start MOO2 1.50, use the desktop shortcut
   created during installation.

   *  To change directory to unzipped package do:
      $ cd "~/Downloads/MOO2-1.50.x"

   ** At least Ubuntu & Mint require installation of Tcl/Tk before step 2, run:
      $ sudo apt-get install tcl tk

   ^  Tested on Mac OS X Snow Leopard. MOO2 Launcher might not work properly on
      newer Mac OS versions. In such case, manual install without MOO2 Launcher
      is still possible.

                             ---------------------
----------------------------- MANUAL INSTALLATION ------------------------------
                             ---------------------
MOO2 Launcher runs on recent Windows, Linux and Mac OS X systems. Still it may
happen that on your system it doesn't work. In that case you can install the
patch manually.

1. Find in the 1.50 package the directory named "patch". Copy all its contents
   into your MOO2 directory. (So not "patch" itself, but what's inside.)
   The MOO2 directory is the one that contains ORION2.EXE, it's location may
   vary depending on OS and distribution. If you already have a version of 1.50
   installed then choose to overwrite files.

2. Update your DOSBox config files to run ORION150.EXE instead of ORION2.EXE.

3. Run the game and confirm that the version number in the bottom right corner
   of MOO2's Title screen is 1.50.x.

4. Edit file 150/ENABLE.CFG manually to change enabled mods.

------------------------------- TROUBLESHOOTING --------------------------------
                               -----------------
?  Do I need to make a backup of my build lists before updating to new version?

     Your build lists are automatically backed-up during installation with
     MOO2 Launcher. They can be retrieved in directory '150-backups'.

?  MOO2 Launcher runs but fails to install with 'permission denied' error.
?  MOO2 Launcher runs but cannot locate game files on your system.

     This happens if the destination is write-protected, for example for the
     CD-rom version installed to Program Files. Make MOO2 directory accessible
     or move the game to an accessible location, like C:\GAMES\MOO2.

     In some cases you can workaround the issue by running MOO2 Launcher as an
     administrator, but you'll have to do it every time you run it, so that's
     not recommended. This problem doesn't affect Steam and GOG packages even
     though Steam installs to Program Files.

?  MOO2 Launcher runs but fails to install with 'Error creating backup'.

     This can happen if an instance of Windows Explorer is open that has focus
     on a directory or file inside the MOO2 game directory. Close the Explorer.

     This can also happen if you have a previous version MOO2 Launcher still
     running. Make sure you have that MOO2 Launcher closed before updating.

?  On OS X, MOO2 Launcher shows a black panel and no installation options show.

     The Tsch based menu has a black background, causing MOO2 Launcher to show
     black only. MOO2 Launcher is actually functional, and should you have all
     its fields memorized and skillfully TAB through all fields, you can still
     install the game. There is currently no real solution for this issue.
     Install the patch manually.

?  DOSBox crashes immediately after starting.

     Try setting output to 'surface'.

?  Game doesn't start, cannot find info.lbx, credits.lbx and diplomse.lbx.

     This happens when the game is installed from an original CD-rom, which by
     default does not copy all game files to disk. To fix it, copy all files
     from CD-rom to e.g. C:\GAMES\MOO2, remove the read-only attribute from all
     files, then install patch 1.31, then install patch 1.50. The order of
     actions is important, install 1.31 after copying the cd-rom files.

?  Game doesn't start, cannot find techname.lbx.

     This happens with manual install if the MOO2 game is not correctly mounted
     in DOSBox. To fix it, mount to the MOO2 directory root in your .conf file,
     eg: mount C "C:\GAMES\MOO2" instead of for example: mount C "C:\GAMES".
     (In latter case you'd also need: cd MOO2.)

?  Music plays, but no sound effects.

     You need to make the file sound.lbx writable. On Windows right-click it,
     choose properties, remove read-only checkbox.

?  Game interface lags, sound is crackling.

     May happen on Ubuntu with opengl output. Try 'overlay'.

?  How to edit DOSBox options not accessible via MOO2 Launcher?

     Edit file 150/dosbox.conf in the game directory. Note that the settings in
     this file override MOO2 Launcher settings, so if you e.g. force resolution
     there, changing it in MOO2 Launcher will no longer work.

?  I want the game to run in 16:9 mode.

     The game was designed for 4:3 monitors. In DOSBox windowed mode you can
     only have that. In full screen your monitor handles whether to stretch to
     maximum resolution, explore its OSD to figure out how to do it. Note that
     you will never have a true 16:9 picture, the game uses a fixed resolution
     and in 16:9 everything will look stretched.

?  I'm trying to create custom BUILD lists but editing the 150\build\build*.cfg
   files doesn't do anything. The original BUILD lists are still loaded.

     You have edited the wrong files. Open the BUILD lists from MOO2 Launcher's
     menu 'Game>Build lists' to make sure the correct files are edited.

?  I'm hosting multiplayer game, but get black screen after race selection.

     Make sure everyone runs MOO2 Launcher as administrator.
     
?  Trying to join a multiplayer game, but cannot find the game.

     Try running MOO2 Launcher as administrator.
